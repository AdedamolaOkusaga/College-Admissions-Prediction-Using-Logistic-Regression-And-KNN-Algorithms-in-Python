# College_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression_And_K-Nearest-Neighbors_Algorithm

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`College_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression_And_K-Nearest_Neighbor.ipynb`) that demonstrates the use of logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor algorithms for college prediction.

## Overview
The notebook explores a dataset called `go to college.csv` which contains information about students and their likelihood of going to college. The dataset includes features such as type of school, school accreditation, gender, interests, residence, parent's age, parent's salary, house area, average grades, and whether the parent was in college. The target variable is whether the student will go to college or not.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this notebook:
- pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: for mathematical operations
- matplotlib: for data visualization
- seaborn: for enhanced data visualization
- scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and tools

## Contents
The notebook is divided into multiple code cells, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a brief summary of each code cell:

1. Importing necessary libraries: This code cell imports all the required libraries for the analysis.

2. Loading the dataset: The code cell loads the `go to college.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame called `college`.

3. Checking the first 5 rows of the data: This code cell displays the first 5 rows of the `college` DataFrame to get an initial understanding of the data.

4. Summary statistics of numerical features: This code cell provides summary statistics for numerical features in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

## Conclusion
This notebook serves as an example of how to use logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor algorithms for college prediction. The code can be used as a starting point for further analysis or as a reference for implementing similar prediction tasks.
